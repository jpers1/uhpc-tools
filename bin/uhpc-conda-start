# uhpc-conda-start: Mount a SquashFS-based conda environment in /dev/shm, without activation.
#
# Usage:
#   uhpc-conda-start <SQUASHFS_FILE>
#
# Where:
#   <SQUASHFS_FILE> = Path to the .sqsh (or .squashfs) file containing a conda environment.
#                     The environment name is derived from the file's basename (minus '.sqsh').
#
# Behavior:
#   1) Resolve <SQUASHFS_FILE> to a full path.
#   2) If a mount for that environment is already present, unmount it.
#   3) Copy the .sqsh file into /dev/shm/$USER/ if it's not already under /dev/shm.
#   4) Mount read-only at /dev/shm/$USER/conda/conda_envs/<ENV_NAME>.
#   5) Print instructions for manual conda activation if desired.
#
# Requirements:
#   - 'squashfuse' installed
#   - read/write access to /dev/shm
#   - If you want to use "conda activate", do so manually by specifying the full path.
#
# Part of "uhpc-tools" (Unusual HPC Tools).
